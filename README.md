Selenium Wrap is a simple wrapper framework which allows you to write your test code that are neutral to your underlying web driver.  A way to go if you need to hook up to a different vendor api later point for some reasons.   So write your test independent of Selenium calls and keep your test code clean and get great control over it in managing its life cycle.
